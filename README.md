## Theme

Syntax highlighting works with any theme but "Flatland Monokai" is recommended.

## Status

- [x] advanced syntax highlighting
- [x] completion
- [x] linting
- [x] outline view for symbols (`⇧⌘O`)
- [x] type-on-hover
- [x] jump-to-definition (*`⌃` + click* or *`⌘` + hover*)

- [ ] build tool integration
- [ ] debugger integration
- [ ] toplevel integration

The VS Code [insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) is recommended since it provides scrollable hovers (shown above).
